/**
 *  Example display class Swing Component that is able
 *  to contain an image.  The size of the image
 *  and size of the container can be different.
 *  The image can be positioned within the
 *  container.  This class extends JPanel in order
 *  to support layout management.  Tiling is supported
 *  as of JDK1.3 via drawRenderedImage().
